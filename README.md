This is a simple project build with React.
It's a basic Pomodoro app, you can change the time for every session and break time, by default they are set to 25 minutes per session and 5 per break, you can change maximum to 60 minutes each.
Also, it notifies you when your time ended with a beep sound.

<!-- HOW IT WORKS -->
## How it Works

Its created with create-react-app. It has a very simplistic and flat design with arrows for selecting the time for the session or the break, it has a beautiful minimalistic display with the time left, and the play/stop button and the reset button. Its build with react and has three main components the Pomodoro app, the display component, and the length box component (where you can change the time for the session or break).
This is the last project to obtain the Front End Libraries Certification by FreeCodeCamp. The other projects are on [CodePen.io](https://codepen.io/redacuve)

### Running the code

*   Navigate to the root directory of the project

*   Run this command on your terminal to run the code locally on http://localhost:3000:
    ```
    $ npm start
    ```
*   Also you can build this app for production, react are going to make a build folder with minified files, and filenames with hashes for best performance
    ```
    $ npm build
    ```
*   You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
